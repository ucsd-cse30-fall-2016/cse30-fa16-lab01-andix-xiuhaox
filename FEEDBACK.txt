Good commenting. Needs edge cases testing.

Need to add tests cases for your functions, especially float (+/- infinity, NaN). Maybe you were relying on GradeScope
feedback, but that shouldn't be the case. Also, make sure you understand how floats were input (unsigned). You were
supposed to use f2u to ensure that what you were testing was actually the case you thought you were testing.
